# photo-dump-organizer

Organize your photos, by year/month they were taken

Works for photos taken with Pixel phones (naming convention)

Steps:
Double click PhotoOrganizer.exe
Browse through folders
Select any file in the target directory
The application will automatically use the parent folder of that file
Click "Organize Photos"
Your photos will be sorted into folders by YYYY.MM format

For Example:
PXL_20230805_143320496.jpg
PXL_20230902_162747419.jpg
PXL_20230923_104907733.jpg

will be sorted into the following folders:

2023.08 (1 File)
2023.09 (2 Files)

Logs of files moved and files skipped are reported in real time so you can track the reorganization as it runs.
